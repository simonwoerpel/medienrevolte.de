## A CROSS-BORDER INVESTIGATION

*Fraudsters are every year robbing Europeâ€™s citizens of 50 billion euros in tax
money. A Europe-wide investigation by 63 journalists from 30 countries,
coordinated by CORRECTIV.*

**me:**
- making a big bunch of (really huge) confidential documents searchable and
  securely accessible for 63 journalists from 30 countries to work
  collaboratively on this investigation. me & [CORRECTIV Nerds](https://correctiv.org/nerds/)
  also set up the secure infrastructure and provided security trainings and
  support for the colleagues.
- building the [internal software CORRECTIV](/software/boromeo/) uses to handle
  these kind of document-based investigations
