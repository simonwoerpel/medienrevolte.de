## A CROSS-BORDER INVESTIGATION

*How Europe's taxpayers have been swindled of €55 billion*

The vast so-called cum ex tax scandal which has rocked Germany in the past
decade has already cost the country an estimated €30 billion. It was assumed
that a change in the law in 2016 definitively outlawed such trades. But as a
cross-border and undercover investigation now reveals, the trade is still
flourishing and has targeted far more countries and has cost far more than was
previously thought, affecting nearly all of the biggest economies in Europe. Is
this the heist of the century?

**me:**
- making a big bunch of (really huge) confidential documents searchable and securely accessible for 38 journalists from 12 countries to work collaboratively on this investigation. me & [CORRECTIV nerds](https://correctiv.org/nerds/) also provided security trainings and support for the colleagues.
- building [the website & longread](https://cumex-files.com) (based on some contributions of others)
