# Hi, I'm Simon.

### investigative data journalist

i am an independent investigative data journalist and leak librarian.

that means i can deal with a huge amount of data and documents, analyze them
and orchestrate security infrastructure around it so that cross-border
investigative journalism teams can can have access, and no one other, to do
powerful investigations. i can even help researching, as i am originally a
journalist.

as i am a freelancer, you can hire me for this kind of tasks.
